# Setting the preferred domain | Google Search Central Blog | Google for Developers

Tuesday, September 12, 2006

Based on your input, we've recently made a few changes to the preferred domain feature of Webmaster Tools. And since you've had some questions about this feature, we'd like to answer them.

The
[preferred domain feature](https://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=44231&topic=9025)
enables you to tell us if you'd like URLs from your site crawled and indexed using the www
version of the domain (`https://www.example.com`

) or the non-www version of the domain
(`https://example.com`

). When we initially launched this, we added the non-preferred
version to your account when you specified a preference so that you could see any information
associated with the non-preferred version. But many of you found that confusing, so we've made the
following changes:

- When you set the preferred domain, we no longer will add the non-preferred version to your account.
- If you had previously added the non-preferred version to your account, you'll still see it listed there, but you won't be able to add a Sitemap for the non-preferred version.
- If you have already set the preferred domain and we had added the non-preferred version to your account, we'll be removing that non-preferred version from your account over the next few days.

Note that if you would like to see any information we have about the non-preferred version, you can always add it to your account.

Here are some questions we've had about this preferred domain feature, and our replies.

**Once I've set my preferred domain, how long will it take before I see changes?** The time
frame depends on many factors (such as how often your site is crawled and how many pages are
indexed with the non-preferred version). You should start to see changes in the few weeks after
you set your preferred domain.

**Is the preferred domain feature a filter or a redirect? Does it simply cause the search results
to display on the URLs that are in the version I prefer?** The preferred domain feature is not
a filter. When you set a preference, we:

- Consider all links that point to the site (whether those links use the www version or the non-www version) to be pointing at the version you prefer. This helps us more accurately determine PageRank for your pages.
- Once we know that both versions of a URL point to the same page, we try to select the preferred version for future crawls.
- Index pages of your site using the version you prefer. If some pages of your site are indexed using the www version and other pages are indexed using the non-www version, then over time, you should see a shift to the preference you've set.

**If I use a 301 redirect on my site to point the www and non-www versions to the
same version, do I still need to use this feature?** You don't have to use it, as we can
follow the redirects. However, you still can benefit from using this feature in two ways: we can
more easily consolidate links to your site and over time, we'll direct our crawl to the preferred
version of your pages.

**If I use this feature, should I still use a 301 redirect on my site?** You don't
need to use it for Googlebot, but you should still use the

`301`

redirect, if it's
available. This will help visitors and other search engines. Of course, make sure that you point
to the same URL with the preferred domain feature and the `301`

redirect.
