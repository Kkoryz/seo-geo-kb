# Using a robots.txt file | Google Search Central Blog | Google for Developers

February 24, 2006

A couple of weeks ago, we
[launched a robots.txt](/search/blog/2006/02/more-stats-and-analysis-of-robotstxt)
analysis tool. This tool gives you information about how
[Googlebot](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot)
interprets your robots.txt file. You can read more about the
[robots.txt Robots Exclusion Standard](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9309.html),
but we thought we'd answer some common questions here.

## What is a robots.txt file?

A robots.txt file provides restrictions to search engine robots (known as "bots") that crawl the web. These bots are automated, and before they access pages of a site, they check to see if a robots.txt file exists that prevents them from accessing certain pages.

## Does my site need a robots.txt file?

Only if your site includes content that you don't want search engines to index. If you want search engines to index everything in your site, you don't need a robots.txt file (not even an empty one).

## Where should the robots.txt file be located?

The robots.txt file *must* reside in the root of the domain. A robots.txt file located in
a subdirectory isn't valid, as bots only check for this file in the root of the domain. For
instance, `https://www.example.com/robots.txt`

is a valid location. But,
`https://www.example.com/mysite/robots.txt`

is not. If you don't have access to the
root of a domain, you can restrict access using the
[Robots META tag.](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag)

## How do I create a robots.txt file?

You can create this file in any text editor. It should be an
[ASCII-encoded text file](https://www.google.com/search?q=ascii+text+file),
not an HTML file. The filename should be lowercase.

## What should the syntax of my robots.txt file be?

The simplest robots.txt file uses two rules:

the robot the following rule applies to`User-Agent:`

the pages you want to block`Disallow:`


These two lines are considered a single entry in the file. You can include as many entries as you want. You can include multiple Disallow lines in one entry.

`User-Agent`


A user-agent is a specific search engine robot. The
[Web Robots Database](https://www.robotstxt.org/wc/active.html)
lists many common bots. You can set an entry to apply to a specific bot (by listing the name) or
you can set it to apply to all bots (by listing an asterisk). An entry that applies to all bots
looks like this:

User-Agent: *

`Disallow`


The `Disallow`

line lists the pages you want to block. You can list a specific URL or
a pattern. The entry should begin with a forward slash (/).

-
**To block the entire site**, use a forward slash:`Disallow: /`

-
**To block a directory**, follow the directory name with a forward slash:`Disallow: /private_directory/`

-
**To block a page**, list the page:`Disallow: /private_file.html`


URLs are case-sensitive. For instance, `Disallow: /private_file.html`

would block
`https://www.example.com/private_file.html`

, but would allow
`https://www.example.com/Private_File.html`

.

## How do I block Googlebot?

Google uses several user-agents. You can block access to any of them by including the bot name on the User-Agent line of an entry.

-
**Googlebot:**crawl pages from our[web index](https://www.google.com/). -
**Googlebot-Mobile:**crawls pages for our[mobile index](https://mobile.google.com/mobile_search.html). -
**Googlebot-Image:**crawls pages for our[image index](https://www.google.com/imghp?tab=wi&q=). -
**Mediapartners-Google:**crawls pages to determine[AdSense content](https://www.google.com/adsense/)(used only if you show AdSense ads on your site).

## Can I allow pages?

Yes, Googlebot recognizes an extension to the robots.txt standard called `Allow`

. This
extension may not be recognized by all other search engine bots, so check with other search
engines you're interested in to find out. The `Allow`

line works exactly like the
`Disallow`

line. Simply list a directory or page you want to allow.

You may want to use `Disallow`

and `Allow`

together. For instance, to block
access to all pages in a subdirectory except one, you could use the following entries:

User-Agent: Googlebot Disallow: /folder1/ User-Agent: Googlebot Allow: /folder1/myfile.html

Those entries would block all pages inside the folder1 directory except for
`myfile.html`

.

## I don't want certain pages of my site to be indexed, but I want to show AdSense ads on those pages. Can I do that?

Yes, you can `Disallow`

all bots other than `Mediapartners-Google`

from
those pages. This keeps the pages from being indexed, but lets
`Googlebot-MediaPartners`

bot analyze the pages to determine the ads to show.
`Googlebot-MediaPartners`

bot doesn't share pages with the other Google user-agents.
For instance, you could use the following entries:

User-Agent: * Disallow: /folder1/ User-Agent: MediaPartners-Google Allow: /folder1/

## I don't want to list every file that I want to block. Can I use pattern matching?

Yes, Googlebot interprets some pattern matching. This is an extension of the standard, so not all bots may follow it.

## Matching a sequence of characters

You can use an asterisk (`*`

) to match a sequence of characters. For instance, to block
access to all subdirectories that begin with `private`

, you could use the following
entry:

User-Agent: Googlebot Disallow: /private*/

## How can I make sure that my file blocks and allows what I want it to?

You can use our
[robots.txt analysis tool](/search/blog/2006/02/analyzing-robotstxt-file) to:

- Check specific URLs to see if your robots.txt file allows or blocks them.
- See if Googlebot had trouble parsing any lines in your robots.txt file.
- Test changes to your robots.txt file.

Also, if you don't currently use a robots.txt file, you can create one and then test it with the tool before you upload it to your site.

## If I change my robots.txt file or upload a new one, how soon will it take effect?

We generally download robots.txt files about once a day. You can see the last time we downloaded
your file by accessing the robots.txt tab in your Sitemaps account and checking the
**Last downloaded** date and time.
