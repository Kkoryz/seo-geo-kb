# Using the robots meta tag | Google Search Central Blog | Google for Developers

Tuesday, March 06, 2007

Recently, Danny Sullivan brought up good questions about how
[search engines handle meta tags](https://searchengineland.com/070228-140603.php).
Here are some answers about how we handle these tags at Google.

## Multiple content values

We recommend that you place all content values in one `meta`

tag. This keeps the `meta`

tags easy to
read and reduces the chance for conflicts. For instance:

<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />

If the page contains multiple `meta`

tags of the same type, we will aggregate the content values.
For instance, we will interpret

<meta name="robots" content="noindex" /> <meta name="robots" content="nofollow" />

the same way as:

<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" />

If content values conflict, we will use the most restrictive. So, if the page has these `meta`

tags:

<meta name="robots" content="noindex" /> <meta name="robots" content="index" />

We will obey the `noindex`

value.

## Unnecessary content values

By default, Googlebot will index a page and follow links to it. So there's no need to tag pages
with content values of `index`

or `follow`

.

## Directing a robots `meta`

tag specifically at Googlebot

To provide instruction for all search engines, set the meta name to `robots`

. To
provide instruction for only Googlebot, set the meta name to `Googlebot`

. If you want
to provide different instructions for different search engines (for instance, if you want one
search engine to index a page, but not another), it's best to use a specific `meta`

tag for each
search engine rather than use a generic robots `meta`

tag combined with a specific one. You can find
a [list of bots](https://www.robotstxt.org/db) at robotstxt.org.

## Casing and spacing

Googlebot understands any combination of lowercase and uppercase. So each of these `meta`

tags is
interpreted in exactly the same way:

<meta name="robots" content="noodp" /> <meta name="Robots" content="noodp" /> <meta name="Robots" content="NoOdp" />

If you have multiple content values, you must place a comma between them, but it doesn't matter if
you also include spaces. So the following `meta`

tags are interpreted the same way:

<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow" /> <meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" />

## If you use both a robots.txt file and robots `meta`

tags

If the robots.txt and `meta`

tag instructions for a page conflict, Googlebot follows the most
restrictive. More specifically:

-
If you block a page with robots.txt, Googlebot will never crawl the page and will never read any
`meta`

tags on the page. -
If you allow a page with robots.txt but block it from being indexed using a
`meta`

tag, Googlebot will access the page, read the`meta`

tag, and subsequently not index it.

## Valid meta robots content values

Googlebot interprets the following robots `meta`

tag values:

`noindex`

: prevents the page from being included in the index.-
`nofollow`

: prevents Googlebot from following any links on the page. (Note that this is different from the link-level`nofollow`

attribute, which prevents Googlebot from following an individual link.) -
`noarchive`

: prevents a cached copy of this page from being available in the search results. -
`nosnippet`

: prevents a description from appearing below the page in the search results, as well as prevents caching of the page. -
`noodp`

: blocks the[Open Directory Project](https://www.dmoz.org/)description of the page from being used in the description that appears below the page in the search results. `none`

: equivalent to`noindex, nofollow`

.

## A word about content value `none`


As defined by
[robotstxt.org](https://www.robotstxt.org/wc/meta-user), the
following direction means `noindex, nofollow`

.

<meta name="robots" content="none" />

However, some webmasters use this tag to indicate no robots restrictions and inadvertently block all search engines from their content.
