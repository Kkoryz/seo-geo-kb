# Introducing Rich Cards | Google Search Central Blog | Google for Developers

Tuesday, May 17, 2016

Rich cards are a new Search result format building on the success of rich snippets. Just like rich snippets, rich cards use schema.org structured markup to display content in an even more engaging and visual format, with a focus on providing a better mobile user experience.

For site owners, this is a new opportunity to stand out in Search results and attract more targeted users to your page. For example, if you have a recipe site, you can build a richer preview of your content with a prominent image for each dish. This visual format helps users find what they want right away, so you're getting users who specifically want that especially delicious cookie recipe you have.

We're starting to show rich cards for two content categories: recipes and movies. They will appear initially on mobile search results in English for google.com. We're actively experimenting with more opportunities to provide more publishers with a rich preview of their content.

We've built a comprehensive set of tools and completely updated our developer documentation to take site owners and developers from initial exploration through implementation to performance monitoring.

## Explore rich card types and identify where your content fits

Browse the [new gallery](/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/search-gallery) with screenshots and code
samples of each markup type.

## Test and tweak your markup

We strongly recommend using JSON-LD in your implementation.

-
Find out
[which fields are essential](/search/docs/guides/mark-up-content)to mark up in order for a rich card to appear. We've also listed additional fields that can enhance your rich cards. -
See a preview in the
[revamped Structured Data Testing Tool](/search/docs/advanced/structured-data)of how the rich card might appear in Search (currently available for recipes and movies). - Use the Structured Data Testing Tool to see errors as you tweak your markup in real time.

## Keep track of coverage and debug errors

Check how many of your rich cards are indexed in the
[new Search Console Rich Cards report](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/rich-cards).

- Keep an eye out for errors (also listed in the Rich Cards report). Each error example links directly to the Structured Data Testing tool so you can test it.
-
[Submit a sitemap](/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap)to help us discover all your marked-up content.

## Find opportunities for growth

In the Rich Cards report, you'll see which cards can be enhanced by marking up additional fields.

## Monitor performance

A new "Rich results" filter in Search Analytics (currently in a closed beta) will help you track how your rich cards and rich snippets are doing in search: you'll be able to drill down and see clicks and impressions for both.

## FAQ

### Can I keep my existing rich snippets markup?

Yes, you can! We'll keep you posted as the rich result ecosystem evolves.

### What about the Structured Data report in Search Console?

The Structured Data report will continue to show only
[top-level entities](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/2650907)
for the existing rich snippets (Product, Recipe, Review, Event, SoftwareApplication, Video, News
article) and for any new categories (for example, Movies). We plan to migrate all errors from the
Structured Data report into the Rich Card report.

### What if I use the wrong markup?

Technical and quality guidelines apply for rich cards as they do for rich snippets. We will enforce them as before.
